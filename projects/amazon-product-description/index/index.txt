8:Tb71,<h1>Amazon Description Generator</h1>
<p>This is a proof of concept for an AI that generates Amazon-like product descriptions <strong>that sell</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/cover.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I was contacted by the founder of <a href="https://texta.ai/">Texta.ai</a> and asked to recreate thier product that works cheaper. They used GPT-3 from Open AI to generate text descriptions and their price was not cheap enough to make the buisness profitable.</p>
<p>I started of by scraping data with Puppeteer from top Amazon products, but that turned out to be a bit of a challenge. Their websites took a tremendous amount of time to load and the scraping process was not very efficient. That's why I changed to a scrapped <a href="https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/">dataset</a> by UCSD. All the collected data was cleaned and shaped into prompt templates.</p>
<p>After the data was ready, I finetuned multiple <a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/projects/gpt-neo/">GPT-Neo</a> models using the <a href="https://happytransformer.com/">Happy Transformer</a> library on Google Colab.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>From the following input:</p>
