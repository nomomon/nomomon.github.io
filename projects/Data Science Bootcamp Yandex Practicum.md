Yandex Practicum is a data science bootcamp that I attended in 2022. The bootcamp is a 9-month long program that covers the basics of data science and machine learning. The program is divided into 3 modules:

-   Data Preprocessing,
-   Data Analysis,
-   Machine Learning.

Each module consists of 3-4 projects that tackle close to real-world problems. The projects are evaluated by a team of mentors. The final project is a capstone project that is made for and evaluated by real companies.
