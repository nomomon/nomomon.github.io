The bootcamp is a 9-month long program that covers the basics of data science and machine learning. The program is divided into 3 modules:\n\n-   Data Preprocessing,\n-   Data Analysis,\n-   Machine Learning.\n\nEach module consists of 3-4 projects that tackle close to real-world problems. The projects are evaluated by a team of mentors. The final project is a capstone project that is made for and evaluated by real companies.\n\n## Projects\n\n**The project solutions are not shared publicly to prevent plagiarism.
