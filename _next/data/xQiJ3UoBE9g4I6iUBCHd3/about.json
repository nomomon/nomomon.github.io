There I am learning how to preprocess and analyze data, perform statistical analysis and prove hypothesis and use machine learning to improve business metrics.\n- My recent project was [predicting energies of molecules](https://github.com/nomomon/molecule-energy-prediction) using feed-forward neural networkds. As input data, I was given the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. In this project I preprocessed the data, converted values into right units, framed the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) to get the required data and then trained a neural network with the suiting hyperparameters. I am glad that I got to do this project as it involed a lot of research into chemistry, how atoms are bonding, properties of electrons and energiese of molecules.\n\n## Links\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nomomon)\n- [Personal website](https://nomomon.github.io/)\n- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mononom)\n- [Hugging face](https://huggingface.co/nomomon)\n- [Telegram channel](https://t.me/pigeorge)"},"__N_SSG":true}
