The app is built using React and Node.js.\n\nIt works by transforming the plane (image) accoring to the following rule:\n\n> Each point $P$ is mapped to the point $P'$ on a ray $OP$, such that $OP \\cdot OP' = R^2$, where $R$ is the radius of the inversion.\n> Working with pixels makes the coordinates descrete and to improve the quality of the image, the root mean squared [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKnqECcg6Gw&ab_channel=minutephysics) of pixel values are taken.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
