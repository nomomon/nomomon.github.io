<p>Dutch universities do not provide accommodation, but help international students in their search. They provide services like SSH, funda, Pararius, ROOM, ect.</p>
<p>Kamernet is one of these platforms. When I began using it, I quickly understood that it is very competetive, and it’s not me who chooses a home, but a home (landlord) chooses me. Many landlord have said that they are looking for a Dutch student, or that they need people now, or they say that somebody replied earlier.</p>
<p>Sending out messages by hand was a difficult and time consuming task. So, the most obvious solution was make a bot message to every home and hope that I get to a viewing.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Kamernet Puppeteer is such a bot, it uses Puppeteer (duh.) to automate the process of sending out messages. It turned on every 5 minutes to check if there are any new adverts and this way I would be one of the first to respond.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I was invited to a few homes, but the deals would not work out. However, through it, I met my future best friend, who helped me to get a room at their house :)</p>
