<p><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feeds</a> are a convenient and old–fashioned way to follow blogs and websites.</p>
<p>This December, I returned to reading as my main source of getting information. In doing so, I came across a recommendation system with a Naive Bayes classifier, which was used to filter an RSS feed. This inspired me to create a similar application for myself.</p>
<p>The idea of the project is to collect posts from RSS feeds, use the classifier to predict whether I will like the post or not, and then train the algorithm on my reactions. Hence, this algorithm is learning in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning">online mode</a>.</p>
<p>At first I used a Telegram bot as an interface, but I encountered a lot of errors and inconveniences when parsing messages. I also used PocketBase for the backend, but it turned out that it is still in beta and query functions I needed were not available. As the result, I changed the stack to Next.js with MUI for frontend and Firebase for backend.</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>With the latest update, I&#x27;ve made it easier and more efficient for users to access and filter their news.</p>
<p>One of the major updates I&#x27;ve made is the addition of authentication. Now, users can create their own accounts and have all their data stored in a single object, making it easier to query and manage.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve also streamlined the process of retrieving data by making all necessary requests in a single request. This not only makes the process faster, but it also helps stay within the Firebase free limit.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s not all - I&#x27;ve also improved the functionality of our Naive Bayes classifier. Rather than simply classifying articles as either liked or not liked, it now considers the approximate probability of a user liking an article. This gives users a more personalized experience and helps them find the content that is most relevant to them.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#x27;ve hosted the app on Vercel, a reliable and user-friendly platform. The only issue I&#x27;ve encountered is the limitation of 12 requests for server functions on the free plan. While I understand that paying the $20/month fee will make the app be perfect, I cannot afford that for a personal use project.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#x27;m confident that my RSS feed application will provide users with a valuable and enjoyable experience. I hope you&#x27;ll give it a try and see for yourself!</p></div></article></div></div><footer class="w-full flex flex-row justify-center my-8"><p class="text-gray-500">Made with ❤️ by<a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" href="https://github.com/nomomon"> nomomon</a></p></footer><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"fileName":"Bayes Feed","file":"---\ndescription: An RSS feed with a Naive Bayes recommender that is learning online.\nimageURL: bayes-feed.jpeg\ndate: 17 Dec, 2022\nendDate: 28 Dec, 2022\ndemo: https://bayes-feed.vercel.app/\nsource: https://github.com/nomomon/bayes-feed\ntags: [next.js, firebase, material-ui, nlp, rss, vercel, project]\n\n---\n\n![[bayes-feed.jpeg]]\n\n[RSS feeds](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) are a convenient and old–fashioned way to follow blogs and websites. \n\nThis December, I returned to reading as my main source of getting information.
