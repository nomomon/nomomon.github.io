## Backgroud

- I am a Data Scientist.
- BSc Artificial Intelligence from [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/artificial-intelligence/?lang=en)

## Current projects

- Currently, I am [improving](https://github.com/nomomon/yandex-data-science) my data science skills by making projects at the [Y.Practicum](https://practicum.com/data-scientist/) bootcamp. There I am learning how to preprocess and analyze data, perform statistical analysis and prove hypothesis and use machine learning to improve business metrics.
- My recent project was [predicting energies of molecules](https://github.com/nomomon/molecule-energy-prediction) using feed-forward neural networkds. As input data, I was given the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. In this project I preprocessed the data, converted values into right units, framed the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) to get the required data and then trained a neural network with the suiting hyperparameters. I am glad that I got to do this project as it involed a lot of research into chemistry, how atoms are bonding, properties of electrons and energiese of molecules.
